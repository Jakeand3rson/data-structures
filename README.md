# Python Data Structures

*This repository will hold example code for a number of classic data structures.*

We created a linked list method where the list knows about the first element, and each element is linked to the element behind it.

We also created a stack where an element can be added to the top of the stack, and popped from the top. But they are not linked and you can only manipulate the top of the stack.

We implemented a queue where an item is added into the queue and--contrary to a stack--are removed in the same order they're placed in. Each item is aware of the previous and next items. The list is aware of the first and last item in the list.

We revisted our previous linked list to create a double linked list. Each node of the list points at the next and previous items. The list has pointers for the first and last item of the list.

Binary Heap is a program that will build a tree of data, and prioritize it based on its value and the value of the 'child' notes below it. We used [interactivepython.org](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/Trees/BinaryHeapImplementation.html) as a reference and to assist in implementing the heap. WARNING: The tests are quite inclusive and can take a little while to run, but prove that the program can handle a load.

This repository is a collaboration between Jake Anderson and James Warren while attending the Code Fellows Python Development Accelerator in Winter 2015.
