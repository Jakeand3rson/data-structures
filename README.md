# Python Data Structures

This repository will hold example code for a number of classic data structures.

We have included a basic graph data structure. Our graph is capable of adding vertices/nodes, adding edges between nodes, deleting nodes and edges, reporting all connected nodes, and reporting nodes connected to it. As an inspiration, we used [this educational site](http://www.python-course.eu/graphs_python.php).


This repository is a collaboration between Jake Anderson and James Warren while attending the Code Fellows Python Development Accelerator in Winter 2015.
