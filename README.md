# Python Data Structures

This repository will hold example code for a number of classic data structures.

We have included a basic graph data structure. Our graph is capable of adding vertices/nodes, adding edges between nodes, deleting nodes and edges, reporting all connected nodes, and reporting nodes connected to it. As an inspiration, we used [this educational site](http://www.python-course.eu/graphs_python.php).

We added a graph that includes traversal. Our graph can do both depth first, and breadth first traversal. We used [the same site](http://www.python-course.eu/graphs_python.php) that assisted in our understanding and constructing of our simple graph, as well as the Fundamentals of Python Data Structures book by Kenneth A Lambert.


This repository is a collaboration between Jake Anderson and James Warren while attending the Code Fellows Python Development Accelerator in Winter 2015.
